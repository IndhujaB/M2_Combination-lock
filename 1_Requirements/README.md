# **COMBINATION LOCK**

## INTRODUCTION:

Combination locks have been there for decades and many products such as briefcase, doors are protected by them. There is keypad module for atmega328 that can help us to set combination password for various things, you may also use RFID cards to provide access and in this tutorial, I am going to explain how you can make push button combination lock.

The project will help us to set combination password and you can set password by using 1-6 digits, When you will push the buttons, and the combination is matched the green LED will be turned on and if the combination is not matched the Red LED will indicate that the password is wrong.

The push buttons can be interfaced by atmega328 using pull down configuration i.e. button will give 5V when pressed and 0V when released and pull up configuration i.e. when button is pressed it will give 0V and when released it will give 5V. We are using pull up configuration and we are not using any external resistor instead we are using atmega328 internal pull up resistor.

Often times, we need to secure a room at our home or office (perhaps a secret dexter’s laboratory) so that no one can access the room without our permission and ensure protection against theft or loss of our important accessories and assets.


ATmega328P is a 8-bitAVRRISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISPflash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM,2 KB SRAM, 23 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, three flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART.


## BENEFITS:

* Better access control.

* The security code cannot be seen.

* Remote updates.


## ADVANTAGES:

* No more keys.

* Convenience.

* Save time and money.

* High security.


## DISADVANTAGES:

* Keep the PIN safe and the lock clean.

* Power Failure.

* Limit the PIN Code Length.

* Code Hacking. 


## OBJECTIVES:

* Combinations locks are something that we can use in a lot of places.

* Codes can be reset in seconds, without removing the unit from the door.




## COMPONENTS:

* Atmega328.

* Positional Micro Servo.

* Red LED.

* Green LED.

* 1 kΩ Resistor.

* Keypad.
